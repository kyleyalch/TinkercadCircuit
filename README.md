I combined the input of a tilt sensor and paired it with an RGB LED to create a stabilization indicator. When the tilt sensor is stable, the RGB light glows green, but as it tilts to one side the LED turns to red. It is functional, as it can be implemented in sensitive machinery to warn the system when it becomes unstable. It can be used in drones, a vehicle that is incredibly sensitive to tilting, and other vehicles such as boats and planes. I can envision people replicating my project to improve on stability detection and adding multiple sensors to measure stability on other axes, such as sideways and up and down.
